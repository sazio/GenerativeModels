[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sazio/VAEs/]

AEs and VAEs implementations are largely based on [Alfredo Canziani](https://atcold.github.io/NYU-DLSP21/)'s Deep Learning lectures at NYU, see the Github repo of the [NYU DL Course](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning)
